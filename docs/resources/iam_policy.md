# cancom_iam_policy (Resource)

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```terraform
resource "cancom_iam_user" "user" {
  name = "test"
}

resource "cancom_iam_policy" "test_policy_azure-app-management" {
  service   = "domdns"
  principal = cancom_iam_user.user.id
  policy {
    profile = "full-access"
  }
}
```

This creates a new policy and assigns it to the selected user.

## Advanced Usage

The `cancom_iam_policy` allows to setup policies using predefined profiles (`policy.profil`). Profile can either be `full-access` or `reader`,
providing either administrative access to the service, or read-only access.

If you want to manage policies on a find-grained basis, you can use `policy.custom` instead:

```terraform
resource "cancom_iam_user" "user" {
  name = "test-user"
}

resource "cancom_iam_policy" "test_policy_azure-app-management" {
  service   = "domdns"
  principal = cancom_iam_user.user.id
  policy {
    custom = {
      createRecords = "*"
      deleteRecords = "*"
      listRecords   = "*"
    }
  }
}
```

You can choose either a `profile` or a `custom` policy.

~> **Note:** `profile` and `custom` are not joined into a single policy. If both are provided, `custom` is prefered over `profile`, and `profile` will be ignored.

~> **Note:** Either `profile` or `custom` must be provided. Otherwise, this resource will fail.
