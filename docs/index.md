# CANCOM Provider

The CANCOM provider is used to interact with the CANCOM Cloud.

To use this provider, you need an active subscription to [CANCOM Marketplace] (https://marketplace.cancom.de/de/home).
Currently, signup is restricted to certain customers, but we plan to open signup to a broader audience soon.

You can reach the CANCOM Cloud here: [https://portal.cancom.io](https://portal.cancom.io)

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cancom = {
      source  = "cancom/cancom"
      version = "0.0.1-pre"
    }
  }
}

provider "cancom" {
  token = "<token>"
}
```

## Authentication

The CANCOM provider can be configured over the following token sources:

* Parameters in the provider configuration
* Environment variables

### Environment Variables

You can omit the token in the provider configuration by setting the `CANCOM_TOKEN` environment variable.
If both `token` and `CANCOM_TOKEN` is set, we prefer the provided `token`.
