# cancom_iam_policy (Resource)

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

{{ tffile "examples/services/iam/resources/iam_policy_profile.tf" }}

This creates a new policy and assigns it to the selected user.

## Advanced Usage

The `cancom_iam_policy` allows to setup policies using predefined profiles (`policy.profil`). Profile can either be `full-access` or `reader`,
providing either administrative access to the service, or read-only access.

If you want to manage policies on a find-grained basis, you can use `policy.custom` instead:

{{ tffile "examples/services/iam/resources/iam_policy_custom" }}

You can choose either a `profile` or a `custom` policy.

~> **Note:** `profile` and `custom` are not joined into a single policy. If both are provided, `custom` is prefered over `profile`, and `profile` will be ignored.

~> **Note:** Either `profile` or `custom` must be provided. Otherwise, this resource will fail.
